# Detector-Based-Classifier

This is an example of my research work.

Together with I.B. Muchnik and N.M. Borisov, I have built a classifier, called Detector-based Classifier (DBC) to predict patients' response to target therapy.

In this repository one can find the DBC algorithm implementation as well as it's usage example. A presentation with full description of the DBC algorithm and my master's thesis for additional information are also added to the repository.
